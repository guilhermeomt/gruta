# Gruta

A simple yet powerful microservice-oriented Node.js backend framework. It's opinionated, but not too much. You can use it to build your own microservice-oriented backend, or use it as a base for your own framework.

> **Note:** This library is part of my final paper for my Computer Science degree. It's not ready for production yet, but I'm working on it. If you want to help, please contact me first.

## Features

- **Microservice-oriented:** Gruta is designed to be used with microservices. It's not a monolithic framework, but a set of tools that can be used to build your own microservice-oriented backend.
- **Simple:** Gruta is simple to use. It's not a framework that tries to do everything for you, but a set of tools that you can use to build your own backend.
- **Opinionated:** Gruta is opinionated yet flexible.
- **Best practices:** Gruta follows best practices for Node.js development, such as using TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Jest, etc.
- **Code quality:** Gruta is built with code quality in mind. It follows principles such as SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI, etc.
- **Code generation:** Gruta uses code generation CLI to make it easier to create new services, models, etc.
